# Tic Tac Toe in C

## Overview

This project is a command-line based Tic Tac Toe game implemented in the C programming language. The main objective of this project is to help me deepen my understanding of C programming, including concepts such as pointers, dynamic memory allocation, and data structures.

## Features

- Standard Tic Tac Toe rules
- Two-player mode
- Command-line interface
- Simple and clean code structure to facilitate learning and understanding

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

To compile and run this project, you will need:

- A C compiler (GCC is recommended)
- A terminal or command-line interface

## How to Play

1. The game starts with an empty 3x3 grid.
2. Players take turns to input their moves in the format: `row col` (e.g., `1 1` for the top-left corner).
3. The game updates the grid with the player's symbol ('X' or 'O') accordingly.
4. The game continues until one player aligns three of their symbols in a row, column, or diagonal, or until all squares are filled resulting in a draw.

## File Structure

- `main.c`: Contains the `main` function and handles the game loop.
- `tictactoe.c`: Contains the core game logic, including move validation, board updates, and game state checks.
- `tictactoe.h`: Header file with function declarations and data structures used in the game.

## Learning Objectives

This project is designed to help me:

- Understand and implement complex algorithms
- Practice using pointers and dynamic memory in C
- Learn about structuring a larger C project
- Improve debugging and problem-solving skills in C

## Contributions

As this is a personal learning project, contributions are welcome! If you have suggestions or improvements, feel free to open an issue or submit a pull request.

## Acknowledgements

Special thanks to the online C programming community and various tutorials and resources that have helped me along the way.
